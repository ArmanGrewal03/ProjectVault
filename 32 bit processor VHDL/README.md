# 32-Bit Processor Data Path Lab

## 1.0 LAB OBJECTIVE

The objective of part b of this lab was to design, build, and test the data path for a 32-bit processor. Using previously completed designs from earlier labs—such as the Program Counter (PC), registers, data memory, and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)—we aimed to integrate these components into a fully functional 32-bit processor. This integration is part of creating the Central Processing Unit (CPU)'s data path. The lab involved thorough testing to ensure that the CPU data path functions correctly across different use cases.
